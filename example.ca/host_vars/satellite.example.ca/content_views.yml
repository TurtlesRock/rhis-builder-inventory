# Much of this configuration can be considered standard. It implements a
# common pattern for content views and composite content views.
# More complex implementations are possible. Samples may be provided for these at a later date.
# For simple environments, you will strip many of these out.

# NOTE: We may implement a list of lists. Isolate each content view configuration in its own
# file and with its own variable name. Then generate a list with the variable names to
# generate a list that is interpreted by the role. It would eliminate a lot of editing
# on a currently **way** too large file where many mistakes are possible.
# This also has a testing advantage as small files and configurations can be managed
# individually. The list of lists allows for easy composition.


# This contains all the definitions for Content Views and Composite Content Views
# It defines the filters and filter rules for the content views as well
